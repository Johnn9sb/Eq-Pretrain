Installation
======================

Installing via pip
------------------

SeisBench can be installed in two ways.
In both cases, you might consider installing SeisBench in a virtual environment, for example using conda.

SeisBench is available directly through the pip package manager. To install locally run. ::

    pip install seisbench

Alternatively, you can install the latest version from source. For this approach, clone `the repository <https://github.com/seisbench/seisbench>`_, switch to the repository root and run: ::

    pip install .

This will install SeisBench in your current python environment from source.
