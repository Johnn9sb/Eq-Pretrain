Contributing to SeisBench
=========================

The model and dataset API is designed to be extended to more general machine learning pipelines not necassarily related to picking and event detection - such as direct estimation of events parameters.
Therefore, we encourage community contributions.
If you are thinking of contributing to SeisBench, by reporting a bug, suggesting a feature, adding a dataset or model or in any other way, have a look at out `contribution guidelines <https://github.com/seisbench/seisbench/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_ on GitHub.
